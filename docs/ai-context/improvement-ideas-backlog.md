# Improvement Ideas Backlog

## üéØ AI Agent Instructions for Developing Ideas

When developing any of these improvement ideas into a full specification document:

1. **ASK THE DEVELOPER FIRST**:
   - What specific problem are they trying to solve?
   - What are their business requirements?
   - Are there any specific constraints or preferences?
   - What is the expected scale of usage?
   - Are there regulatory or compliance requirements?
   - What is the timeline for implementation?

2. **GATHER CONTEXT**:
   - Read `/docs/ai-context/00-project-context.md`
   - Read `/docs/ai-context/01-architecture-overview.md`
   - Check if related improvements exist in `/docs/ai-context/improvements/`
   - Ask about dependencies on other improvements

3. **CREATE SPECIFICATION**:
   - Use `/docs/ai-context/improvements/_template.md` as base
   - Number the file sequentially (next available number)
   - Include all sections from the template
   - Be specific about implementation details
   - Add comprehensive examples

4. **VALIDATE WITH DEVELOPER**:
   - Show draft specification
   - Iterate based on feedback
   - Ensure alignment with project goals

## üìù How to Develop an Idea

### For AI Agents:
```
When a developer selects an idea to develop:

1. Start with: "I'll help you develop [Idea Name]. To create the best specification for your needs, I need to understand your specific requirements."

2. Ask the relevant questions listed under the idea

3. Follow up with:
   - "What is your primary goal with this feature?"
   - "Are there any existing systems this needs to integrate with?"
   - "What is your timeline for implementation?"
   - "Are there any constraints I should be aware of?"

4. Based on answers, create a detailed specification using the template

5. Review with: "Here's the specification based on your requirements. What would you like to adjust?"
```

### For Developers:
```
To develop an idea:

1. Choose an idea from the list
2. Provide context about your specific needs
3. Answer the AI's questions about requirements
4. Review and refine the generated specification
5. The AI will create a numbered improvement file in /docs/ai-context/improvements/
```
