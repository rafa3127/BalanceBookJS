## 💬 About AI-Generated Documentation

This documentation system represents a new approach to managing AI-assisted development. It was created through a collaborative process where:

1. The AI analyzed the existing codebase structure and patterns
2. Understood the accounting domain and double-entry bookkeeping principles
3. Created documentation optimized for future AI assistants
4. Developed an interactive requirements-gathering process
5. Established a scalable framework for continuous improvement

The system is designed to grow with the project - new improvements can be added using the template, and the backlog can be expanded as new needs arise. The AI's understanding of the project will improve with each interaction, making future development more efficient.
